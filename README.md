**Android PDFView** is a library which provides a fast PDFView component for Android, with ```animations```, ```gestures```, and ```zoom```. It's based on [VuDroid](https://code.google.com/p/vudroid/) for decoding the PDF file.

# Get it

Android PDFView is **available in Maven Central**.

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.joanzapata.pdfview</groupId>
	<artifactId>android-pdfview</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
	<type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

# Include PDFView in your layout

```xml
<com.joanzapata.pdfview.PDFView
        android:id="@+id/pdfview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

# Load a PDF file

```java
pdfView.fromAsset(pdfName)
    .pages(0, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3)
    .defaultPage(1)
    .showMinimap(false)
    .enableSwipe(true)
    .onDraw(onDrawListener)
    .onCorruptedFile(onCorruptedFileListener)
    .onLoad(onLoadCompleteListener)
    .onPageChange(onPageChangeListener)
    .load();
```

* ```pages``` is optional, it allows you to filter and order the pages of the PDF as you need
* ```onDraw``` is also optional, and allows you to draw something on a provided canvas, above the current page
